## ✨ Key Features

This dashboard is split into two main sections, each designed to answer critical business questions.

### 📊 General Sales Dashboard
Get a real-time pulse on your business performance. This dashboard includes:
* **Live KPIs:** Instantly view Total Revenue, Total Orders, Unique Customers, and Items Sold.
* **Interactive Country Filter:** Slice and dice the data to analyze sales performance for specific countries or regions.
* **Sales Trends:** A beautiful line chart visualizes revenue over time to track growth and identify seasonal patterns.
* **Top Performers:** Automatically updating bar charts show the Top 10 Products by quantity sold and the most profitable Days of the Week.

### 🎯 RFM Customer Segmentation Analysis
Go beyond sales figures and understand the *people* behind the purchases. The RFM model segments customers based on:
* **Recency:** How recently did they buy?
* **Frequency:** How often do they buy?
* **Monetary:** How much do they spend?

This section features:
* **Segment Distribution Charts:** Instantly see how many customers fall into crucial segments like `champions`, `loyal_customers`, `at_risk`, and `hibernating`.
* **Monetary Value Treemap:** A powerful visual that shows which customer segments contribute the most to your bottom line.
* **Purchase Frequency Analysis:** Compare the average purchase frequency across different segments to identify your most engaged (and least engaged) customers.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Libraries

This project was brought to life with the following technologies:

* **Python:** The core programming language.
* **Streamlit:** For building and deploying the interactive web app.
* **Pandas:** For high-performance data manipulation and cleaning.
* **Plotly Express:** For creating beautiful, interactive, and responsive visualizations.

## 💾 Data Source

This analysis is based on the popular **Online Retail Data Set** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which contains transactional data from a UK-based online retailer.
